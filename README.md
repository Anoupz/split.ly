# Split.ly


## Description

Split.ly allows friends to split wisely common expenses like the ones made during road trips, parties, etc... It is a weekend project made for the only purpose of learning. Things I used: AngularJS, ui-router, MongoDB, mongoose, Nodejs & Async.

## Demo

A live demo is available here: http://projects.kdelemme.com/split.ly/app

A live demo with data is available here: http://projects.kdelemme.com/split.ly/app/#/sheets/539dd3cf60e0a7aa1acb094e/

## Installation

Get the sources:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kdelemme/split.ly.git
```

### NodeJS

In order to start the nodejs server, we need express, async and mongoose dependencies.

In the api directory, install the nodejs dependencies:
```bash
kevin@home:api$ npm install gulp gulp-concat gulp-less
```

### AngularJS

Use Gulp to build your JavaScript sources and to compile the less source:
```bash
kevin@home$ gulp
```

You should see:
```bash
kevin@home:$ gulp
[gulp] Using gulpfile gulpfile.js
[gulp] Starting 'scripts'...
[gulp] Starting 'styles'...
[gulp] Finished 'styles' after 37 ms
[gulp] Finished 'scripts' after 55 ms
[gulp] Starting 'default'...
[gulp] Finished 'default' after 13 Î¼s
```

## Usage

### Server

Starts the nodejs application:
```bash
node api/app.js
```

You should see:
```bash
kevin@home:$ node api/app.js 
[INFO] Your project API started on port 3009
[DB] Successfully connected to: mongodb://localhost/splitly
```

### Client

Open your browser on `http://localhost/split.ly/app` (You need a http server configured to handle localhost/splitly correctly, e.g, Apache, nginx, ...)
